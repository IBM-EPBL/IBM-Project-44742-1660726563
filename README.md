NATURAL DISASTERS INTENSITY ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 

The project mainly classifies the type of Natural Disaster and the intensity by giving an image through the webcam. Natural disasters not only disturb the human ecological system but also destroy the properties and critical infrastructures of human societies and even lead to permanent change in the ecosystem.

Disaster can be caused by naturally occurring events such as earthquakes, cyclones, floods, and wildfires. Many deep learning techniques have been applied by various researchers to detect and classify natural disasters to overcome losses in ecosystems, but detection of natural disasters still faces issues due to the complex and imbalanced structures of images.

To tackle this problem, we developed a multilayered deep convolutional neural network model that classifies the natural disaster and tells the intensity of disaster of natural The model uses an integrated webcam to capture the video frame and the video frame is compared with the Pre-trained model and the type of disaster is identified and showcased on the OpenCV window.


INTRODUCTION :
* Natural disasters are inevitable, and the occurrence of disasters drastically affects the economy, ecosystem and human life. Buildings collapse, ailments spread and sometimes natural disasters such as tsunamis, earthquakes, and forest fires can devastate nations. When earthquakes occur, millions of buildings collapse due to seismological effects.
* Many machine learning approaches have been used for wildfire predictions since the 1990s. A recent study used a machine learning approach in Italy. Floods are the most devastating natural disaster, damaging properties, human lives and infrastructures.
* To map flood susceptibility, an assembled machine learning technique based on random forest (RF), random subspace (RS) and support vector machine (SVM) was used. As the population is growing rapidly, people need to acquire land to live on, and as a result the ecosystem is disturbed horrifically, which causes global warming and increases the number of natural disasters.
* Populations in underdeveloped countries cannot afford damages disasters cause to infrastructures. The aftermath of disasters leaves the humans in miserable situations, and sometimes the devastating effects cannot be detected; additionally, rescue operations cannot take place in most of the places and victims are unable to be identified due to geographical factors of the different areas.
* Disasters such as forest fires spread rapidly in dense areas, so firefighting is difficult to carry out; in this case, development of the strategy to predict such circumstances is crucial so that such disasters can be prevented beforehand.
